    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>A near-Earth object is an asteroid or comet which passes close to the Earth's orbit. In technical terms, a
            NEO is considered to have a trajectory which brings it within 1.3 astronomical units of the Sun and hence
            within 0.3 astronomical units, or approximately 45 million kilometres, of the Earth's orbit. NEOs generally
            result from objects that have experienced gravitational perturbations from nearby planets, moving them into
            orbits that allow them to come close to the Earth.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="types">
        <h2>Types of Near Earth Objects</h2>
        <h3>Asteroids</h3>
        <p>Asteroids are small, rocky bodies that orbit the Sun, primarily located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. They vary widely in size, shape, and composition, with the largest being Ceres, which is classified as a dwarf planet. The majority of asteroids are composed of metals and rocky materials, and they can be categorized into several types based on their composition.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong> C-type (Carbonaceous):</strong>  These are the most common asteroids, making up about 75% of known asteroids. They are dark and rich in carbon, and are thought to contain water and organic compounds. They are typically found in the outer regions of the asteroid belt.
        </li>
        <li><strong> S-type (Silicaceous):</strong>  Comprising about 17% of asteroids, S-types are brighter and made mainly of silicate minerals and metals. They are usually located in the inner asteroid belt.</li> 
        <li><strong> M-type (Metallic):</strong>hese asteroids are composed primarily of nickel and iron and are relatively rare. They are found in the middle region of the asteroid belt and may be remnants of larger bodies that broke apart. </li>
        <li><strong> V-type (Vesta family):</strong>These are associated with the asteroid Vesta and are composed mainly of basaltic rock. They provide insights into the processes that formed the terrestrial planets.
        </li>
        <li><strong>S-type (Silicaceous):</strong>Comprising about 17% of asteroids, S-types are brighter and made mainly of silicate minerals and metals. They are usually located in the inner asteroid belt.
        </li>
        <li><strong>D-type:</strong> These are dark, carbon-rich asteroids found in the outer belt and beyond. They have a very low albedo, making them difficult to detect.
        </li> 
        <li><strong>P-type:</strong> These are primitive asteroids that contain ices and organic materials. They are often found in the outer solar system.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Comets</h3>
    <p>Comets are icy celestial bodies that originate from the outer regions of the solar system, primarily from the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud. They are composed of a mixture of ice, dust, and rocky material. When a comet approaches the Sun, the heat causes the ices to sublimate, creating a glowing coma—a cloud of gas and dust—around the nucleus. This process also forms two distinct tails: a dust tail and an ion tail, both of which always point away from the Sun due to solar wind and radiation. Comets are classified into short-period comets, which take less than 200 years to orbit the Sun, and long-period comets, which can have orbits lasting thousands to millions of years. They are significant for scientific study, as they can provide insights into the early solar system and the origins of water and organic compounds on Earth.</p>
    <p>Comets can be classified into several types based on their orbits and characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1. *Short-period comets*</strong> These have orbits that take less than 200 years to complete. They originate mainly from the Kuiper Belt. Example: Halley's Comet.
        </li>
        <li><strong>2. *Long-period comets*:</strong>These comets have orbits that take more than 200 years and can originate from the Oort Cloud, a distant spherical shell surrounding the solar system. Example: Comet Hale-Bopp.
        </li>
        <li><strong>3. *New comets*:</strong>These are comets that are observed for the first time and have not been seen before.
        </li>
        <li><strong>4. *Recurring comets*:</strong>These are comets that have been observed multiple times and have a predictable orbit. Example: Comet Encke.</li> 
        <li><strong>5. *Hyperbolic comets*:</strong>These comets have orbits that are hyperbolic, indicating that they are not bound to the solar system and will eventually leave it. Example: Comet C/2019 Q4 (Borisov).</li>
        <li><strong>6. *Periodic comets*:</strong> A subclass of short-period comets that have regular, predictable orbits. </li>
        <p>These classifications help astronomers understand the origin and behavior of comets in our solar system.</p>
    </ul>

    <section id="classification">
        <h2>Classification of NEOs</h2>
        <p><p>In our solar system, Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are classified primarily into two types: asteroids and comets.Here's a brief overview of each:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs):</strong> These are asteroids whose orbits bring them close to Earth. They are further categorized into:
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Apollo Group:</strong> These NEOs have orbits that cross Earth's path.</li>
            <li><strong>Amor Group:</strong> These objects approach Earth but do not cross its orbit.</li>
            <li><strong>Atira Group:</strong> These NEOs have orbits that are entirely within Earth's orbit.</li>
            <li><strong>Aten asteroids: </strong>These also cross Earth's orbit but spend most of their time inside it.</li>
            <li><strong>Near-Earth Comets (NECs):</strong>These are comets that come close to Earth. Unlike asteroids, they are composed mainly of ice, dust, and rocky material. They develop tails when they approach the Sun due to the sublimation of their ices.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    </section>

    <section id="hazards">
        <h2>Potential Hazards</h2>
        <p>Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) are asteroids that have orbits bringing them close to Earth and are
            large enough (generally over 140 meters in diameter) to pose a significant risk of impact. They are defined
            by their ability to approach within 0.05 astronomical units (about 7.5 million kilometers) of Earth's orbit.
            Due to their size and proximity, PHAs are monitored closely by space agencies to assess any potential threat
            they may pose in the future.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="importance">
        <h2>Importance of NEO Study</h2>
        <p>Studying Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) is crucial for several reasons. First and foremost, these objects,
            particularly Potentially Hazardous Asteroids, could pose a significant impact risk to Earth, making it
            essential to understand their orbits to predict potential collisions and assess associated risks. Monitoring
            NEOs allows us to develop planetary defense strategies, such as deflection techniques or evacuation plans if
            necessary. Additionally, NEOs serve as valuable scientific resources, providing insights into the early
            solar system since they are remnants from its formation; studying their composition and structure enhances
            our understanding of planetary evolution. Furthermore, some NEOs may contain valuable resources like metals
            and water, presenting opportunities for future mining and space exploration. Lastly, increased awareness and
            knowledge about NEOs can help prepare the public for potential impacts, fostering support for monitoring and
            research initiatives. Overall, the study of NEOs is vital for ensuring planetary safety and advancing our
            understanding of the solar system.
